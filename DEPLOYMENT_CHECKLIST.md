## Render Deployment Steps

### 1. Connect GitHub Repository to Render
1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Click "New +" → "Web Service"
3. Connect GitHub repository: `Jayant-1/floatchat`
4. Select the `main` branch

### 2. Configure Deployment Settings
- **Name**: `floatchat` (or your preferred name)
- **Environment**: `Python 3`
- **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command**: `streamlit run src/main.py --server.port $PORT --server.address 0.0.0.0`
- **Plan**: Free (as configured in render.yaml)

### 3. Environment Variables (if needed)
- No special environment variables required for basic deployment
- All configurations are handled via config.toml and Python files

### 4. Advanced Settings
- **Auto-deploy**: ✅ Enable (deploys automatically on Git push)
- **Runtime**: Will use Python 3.11.10 from runtime.txt

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Test Application Features
- [ ] Home page loads correctly
- [ ] ARGO Floats Map functionality
- [ ] Data Explorer features
- [ ] FloatChat AI chatbot
- [ ] Admin Dashboard access
- [ ] All visualizations render properly

### Performance Checks
- [ ] Initial load time acceptable
- [ ] Interactive features responsive
- [ ] Map rendering performance
- [ ] Data processing speed

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### If Build Fails
1. Check Python version compatibility in runtime.txt
2. Verify all dependencies in requirements.txt
3. Ensure no missing imports in the codebase

### If App Doesn't Start
1. Verify start command in render.yaml
2. Check for missing environment variables
3. Review application logs in Render dashboard

### If Features Don't Work
1. Check streamlit-folium installation
2. Verify all data files are accessible
3. Test locally first before debugging on Render
